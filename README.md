# Phys350 Project - 3-Body Simulation
This project is a simulation of the classical 3-body problem in physics. The user is able to set the mass and starting positions of 3 particles to see how they interact under Newton's laws of motion and Law of Universal Gravitation.

Unlike the two body problem, there is no general closed form solution.

Provided in the simulation are a few starting positions/masses that we have found to create particularly interesting paths and shapes.

## Environment Setup
* Install Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
 * Make sure the "add to path" option is checked at the installation screen.
